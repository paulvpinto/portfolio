is a 3D Rhythm Action Game where the protagonist must face their emotions head on in various dreamscape worlds. They must utilize the power to perform enhanced actions according to their own beat while dodging the attacks of the bosses that match with their song. \\n \\n My responsibilities included \\n -Blueprint scripting the game in Unreal Engine 4 \\n -Designing a three phase boss fight \\n -Designing a rhythmic battle system \\n -Producing the music and sound for the level \\n -Acquiring and creating placeholder assets for the demo\",\r\n                        media:\r\n                            {\r\n                                type: \"video\",\r\n                                url: \"https://youtu.be/ie1hIGDGSec\"\r\n                            }\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    fields: {\r\n                        id: \"2\",\r\n                        title: \"The Design\",\r\n                        paragraph: \"The main inspiration for the game was utilizing the emotional impact music has on an individual. So the first system I designed was creating a boss battle that followed the flow of the music. For the first boss, the basic pattern of attack changes every time the song transitions between each part such as intro to verse, verse to chorus, and etc. This allowed players to grasp the bosses mechanics even as the boss went rampant in the later phases as it still followed the same attack pattern. \\n \\n The next core system was incorporating a rhythm mechanic for the player to time as they fought against the bosses. After some trial and error, I designed a system that wasn’t too distracting and still flowed well with level’s music. There is a drum beat that pulses every bar throughout the song, and whenever the player performs an action at the correct timing they will perform an enhanced version of that action. This allowed for an epic battle against the boss that rewarded player’s who were able to stay in tune.\",\r\n                        media:\r\n                            {\r\n                                type: \"image\",\r\n                                url: InnerTuneImage2\r\n                            }\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    fields: {\r\n                        id: \"3\",\r\n                        title: \"Reflection\",\r\n                        paragraph: \"This first iteration was a great experience as I was able to learn a lot about the different roles of game development and how each aspect of creating the game worked together.

The first set of bosses were called the Oni Brothers with the youngest being the weakest and the oldest being the strongest. \\n \\n The core mechanic that we designed the whole game around was a special attack that would only trigger if the player was able to release their attack at a specific range on a swinging gauge. These special attacks would cause special interactions with different objects in the game such as breaking boulders, interrupting a bosses’ channeling move, or deflecting projectiles.
